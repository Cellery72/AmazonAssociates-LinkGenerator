# AmazonAssociates-LinkGenerator
#### Desktop application that builds Amazon Associate referral links provided a couple items of criteria.

This is a simple Proof-of-Concept application I built on my Sunday morning for a problem I've been facing. On mobile I always struggle to find a quick way to create an affiliate link for Amazon Products. Eventually I'd like to build a mobile app that holds the same functionality as this desktop application.

Based off of the User's Tracking ID and the Product ASIN you can easily generate a link for an Amazon Associates (Canada) or Amazon Affiliate (United States) accounts that you may posses. Easily allows the ability to copy the link to clipboard, open the newly created link, or open a link tester to assure the link is infact a valid referral link.
